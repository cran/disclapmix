Changes in version 1.0
  * Totally rewritten such that the algorithm is more memory and CPU 
    efficient and can be used to analyse larger datasets
  * Internal IWLS algorithm implemented, much faster than glm.fit for this
    kind of data. glm.fit is still available. See glm_method in ?disclapmix.
  * NOTE: Updated API

Changes in version 0.4
  * Fixed error when there is no variation in a subpopulation
    
Changes in version 0.3
  * Fixed error such that verbose = 1 outputs progress information
  * Number of model parameters corrected, which changes marginal and
    full BIC slightly, but only with a constant change meaning that for the 
    same data, the optimal number of centers is the same
  
Changes in version 0.2
	* disclapmix: verbose more fine grained
	* FIXED: disclapmix: use.parallel = TRUE created problems under Windows
	* Corrected minor documentation errors
		
Changes in version 0.1
	* Initial release
